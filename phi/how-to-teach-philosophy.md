# How to teach philosophy
The biggest problems with teaching philosophy today is teacher doesn't care what your student need, they teach things on their schedules. 
## Why this is a problems?
Most people can't understand everything in the world immediately. They only can immediately understand the solution for their current problems, so we have to know their problems in order to teach them.
## How to solve this?
Ask. Observe. Learn your students's behaviours. To know what they need, then provide them what they need if you can.
This also can apply to other areas, likes design, UX, sales, etc,..
